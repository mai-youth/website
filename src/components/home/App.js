        + '20-25 are actively working to provide many of these programs without continuing to develop themselves. Even for the age we believe is most '
        + 'critical for youth development (16 to 20), there is a clear lack of development, mentorship, and guidance.<br><br>'
        + 'We exist to try fill this gap and provide mentorship for youth ages 16 to 25 as we know continuous development and mentorship is not only important, '
        + 'but an essential aspect of a Muslimâ€™s life.',
